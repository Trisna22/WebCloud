                        algorithm to your choise. To view your files, your files will be 
                        decrypted with a key you can create in the beginning. This key can 
                        be a file or a pass-phrase. Note that, if you lose your key, you lose
                                your data.</p>
                <p>The choise of encryption algorithms are:</p>

                        <li>AES 128</li>
                        <li>AES 192</li>
                        <li>AES 256</li>
